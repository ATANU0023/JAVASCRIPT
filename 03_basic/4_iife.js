//IMMEDIATELY  INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS (IIFE)
/*
Function Statement

A function created with a function declaration is a Function object and has all the properties, methods and behavior of Function objects. Example:

function statement(item){
    console.log('Function statement example '+ item);
}

Function Expression

A function expression is similar to function statement except that function name can be omitted to create anonymous functions. Example:

var expression = function (item){
    console.log('Function expression example '+ item);
}

Immediately Invoked Functions Expressions

A soon as function is created it invokes itself doesnâ€™t need to invoke explicitly. In the below example variable iife will store a string that is returned by the function execution.

var iife = function (){
    return 'Immediately Invoked Function Expressions(IIFEs) example ';
}();
caonsole.log(iife); // 'Immediately Invoked Function Expressions(IIFEs) example '
The statement before IIFE should always end with a ; or it will throw an error.

Bad example:

var x = 2 //no semicolon, will throw error
(function(y){
  return x;
})(x); //Uncaught TypeError: 2 is not a function
Why use Immediately Invoked Functions Expressions?

(function(value){
    var greet = 'Hello';
    console.log(greet+ ' ' + value);
})('IIFEs');

In above example when javascript engine execute above code it will create global execution context when it sees code and create function object in memory for IIFE. And when it reaches on line 46 due to which function is Invoked a new execution context is created on the fly and so greet variable goes into that function execution context not into the global this is what makes it unique. This ensures that code inside IIFE does not interfere with other code or be interfered by another code and so code is safe.

*/

(function one(){  
        //this is name iife /because it has a name
    console.log(`DB CONNECTED`)
})(); //to use next iife semicolon must needed.

/*The main reasons for using IIFE are to create a new scope, protect the global scope from variables and functions, and execute code in a local scope immediately after the function is defined.*/

// (function tow(){
//     console.log(`db connected two`)
// })();

((name)=>{   
    //un-name iife         //we can use like this also using arrow function.
    console.log(`db connected two ${name}`)
})("atanu")

//semicolon ";" must important to run two iife ********
